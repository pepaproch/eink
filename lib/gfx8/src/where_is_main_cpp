Grab any example or test file in ../lib/gfx8 and copy it to this src/ directory and compile.

Don't forget to set default_envs in the platformio.ini file to d1_mini or nodemcuv2 
  [platformio]
  default_envs = xxxx

There should be only one *.cpp file in src/ but it does not have to be named main.cp.
